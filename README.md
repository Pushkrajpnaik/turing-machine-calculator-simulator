# Turing Machine Calculator Simulation

This repository contains a collection of header files for simulating a basic calculator using a Turing machine. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and factorial operations. The simulation is based on the principles and theory described in the paper [Construction of Basic Calculator through Turing Machine](https://www.ijetajournal.org/volume-2/issue-6/IJETA-V2I6P1.pdf).

## Introduction

The Turing machine is a theoretical computing device that manipulates symbols on an infinite tape based on a set of rules. This repository implements a Turing machine simulation of a basic calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and factorial calculations.

The simulation aims to provide an understanding of how a Turing machine can be designed and programmed to perform arithmetic operations. It follows the principles outlined in the referenced paper, allowing developers to explore and experiment with the underlying concepts.

## Usage

To use the Turing machine calculator simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/arya2004/Calculator.git
   ```
2. Copy the required header files from the repository to your project directory.
3. Include the desired header file(s) in your C program.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the referenced paper to implement and execute the desired arithmetic operation.

## Getting Started

To understand the concepts and theory behind the Turing machine calculator simulation, it is recommended to read the paper [Simulation of Basic Calculator through Turing Machine](https://www.ijetajournal.org/volume-2/issue-6/IJETA-V2I6P1.pdf). The paper provides detailed information on the design and implementation of the Turing machine, as well as the rules and configurations required for each supported operation.

## Supported Operations

The Turing machine calculator simulation supports the following arithmetic operations:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Factorial (!)

Each operation has its own header file, which contains the necessary definitions, rules, and configurations for simulating the operation using a Turing machine.
